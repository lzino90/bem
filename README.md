Code used in the paper "A behavioural-environmental model to study the impact of climate change denial on environmental degradation" by K. Frieswijk, L. Zino, A. S. Morse, and M. Cao

INSTRUCTIONS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

The code for the simulation is written in MATLAB, using version 2023a and requires no add-ons. All the functions needed are included in the folder. Hence, to run the code it is sufficient to open the folder with MATLAB.

The code has been tested on a PC with 16GB RAM and CPU 1.1 GHz with OS Windows 11 (64-bit). 

ORGANIZATION:

The repository contains the scripts to generate all the figures in the paper. In particular, Figure % (or the panel * of figure %) can be generated by running the file "Fig#.m" or "Fig%*.m."
